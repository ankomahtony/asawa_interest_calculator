Technologies used:

- Python
- Streamlit frameword

`Streamlit is an open source app framework for Machine learning and Data Science projects.`

### Explanation of terms
1. Future Value[^1]
2. Present Value[^2]
3. Interest Rate[^3]
4. Terms(Periods)[^4]

[^1]: Future Value is a value an investor expected given a current value, interest rate and period(in years or month  or both).
[^2]: Present value is a value an investor needed current to acheive a target future value, interest rate and period(in years or month  or both).
This calculation is somethings needed in  discount loans.
[^3]: Interest rate. Here, you have a value and expecting some future value however you don't know an interest appropriate given some period.
[^4]: Finally, you may have the present value and your expected future value with the interest rate but you don't know how long you should allow to yeild that value in future.


### Routing

Its a single route page with no need of authentication.

### Sessions
Information provided is keep in session for each rerun for other computation.

### Database

No database Required

## Possible improvements
